My training was in physics, but my work experience has been in programming (in C++, Java, and Lisp). I am taking the Bloc Software Developer track in order to bring my coding skills up to date in modern web development tools and languages. Hopefully, this will lead to a new successful phase in my career.
I am probably about the oldest student that Bloc has ever had--58. I am hoping that my training here leads to another 10 years or so of satisfying work for me, before retiring.

Some personal information: I have four children, all adopted, of various ethnic background. They are all nearing adulthood (the youngest is 18). I've lived in Ithaca, New York for most of adult life, although I grew up in the South (in Rome, Georgia).
